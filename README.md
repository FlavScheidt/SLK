Introduction
============

Slk is a energy consumption monitoring tool for Hadoop.

SLK is a tool to track and analyze energy consumption of MapReduce-based Database Systems. In MapReduce query processing one single query is translated into one or more MapReduce jobs, where each job consists of one or more tasks. SLK is a tool that enables the analysis of energy consumption per query, per its jobs and per each MapReduce service running in each machine of the cluster.
